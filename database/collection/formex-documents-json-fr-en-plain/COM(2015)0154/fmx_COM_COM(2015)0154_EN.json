It is also necessary to lay down the procedures for the application of this mechanism.(5)Safeguard measures may be considered only if the product in question is imported into the Union in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to Union production, and under such conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause, serious injury to Union producers of like or directly competing products as laid down in Article 165(1) of the Agreement.(6)Certain terms such as ‘serious injury’, ‘threat of serious injury’ and ‘transitional period’ as referred to in Article 169 of the Agreement should be defined.(7)The tasks of following up and reviewing the Agreement, carrying out investigations and, if necessary, imposing safeguard measures should be carried out in the most transparent manner possible.(8)The Commission should receive information including available evidence from the Member States of any trends in imports which might call for the application of safeguard measures.(9)The reliability of statistics on all imports from the Republic of Moldova to the Union is therefore crucial to determining whether the conditions to apply safeguard measures are met.(10)If there is sufficient prima facie evidence to justify the initiation of proceedings, the Commission should publish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union.(11)There should be detailed provisions on the initiation of investigations, access to and inspections by interested parties of the information gathered, hearings for the interested parties involved and the opportunities for those parties to submit their views.(12)The Commission should notify the Republic of Moldova in writing of the initiation of an investigation and consult the Republic of Moldova as provided for in Article 166(1) of the Agreement.(13)It is also necessary to set time limits for the initiation of an investigation and for determinations as to whether or not safeguard measures are appropriate, with a view to ensuring that such determinations are made quickly, in order to increase legal certainty for the economic operators concerned.(14)An investigation should precede the application of any safeguard measure, subject to the Commission being allowed to apply provisional safeguard measures in critical circumstances as referred to in Article 167 of the Agreement.(15)Safeguard measures should be applied only to the extent, and for such time, as may be necessary to prevent serious injury and to facilitate adjustment. The maximum duration of safeguard measures should be determined and specific provisions regarding extension and review of such measures should be laid down.(16)There should be a possibility to suspend the preferential customs duties for a maximum period of six months when the imports of certain agricultural products and processed agricultural products reach the annual import volumes defined in the Annexes (XV-C) to the Association Agreement.(17)For reasons of transparency, the Commission should submit an annual report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of the Agreement and the application of the safeguard measures and the anti-circumvention mechanism.(18)In order to ensure uniform conditions for the adoption of provisional and definitive safeguard measures, for the imposition of prior surveillance measures and for the termination of an investigation without measures provided for in the Agreement, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the CouncilRegulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers (OJ L 55, 28.2.2011, p. 13)..(19)The advisory procedure should be used for the adoption of surveillance and provisional safeguard measures given the effects of those measures and their sequential logic in relation to the adoption of definitive safeguard measures. The advisory procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts given that those acts have to be implemented quickly once the relevant threshold has been met and have only a very limited period of application.(20)The examination procedure should be used for the adoption of definitive safeguard measures and for the reviews of such measures.(21)The Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases a delay in the imposition of provisional safeguard measures would cause damage which would be difficult to repair or in order to prevent a negative impact on the Union market as a result of an increase in imports. Where such immediately applicable implementing acts are applied, the advisory procedure should be used,HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:"},
