Fishing opportunities should be allocated to Member States in such a way as to ensure the relative stability of fishing activities of each Member State for each stock or fishery and having due regard to the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) set out in Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.</p>(4)<p contains=\"p\">The total allowable catches (TACs) should therefore be established, in line with Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, on the basis of the available scientific advice, taking into account biological and socioeconomic aspects whilst ensuring fair treatment between fishing sectors, as well as in the light of the opinions expressed during the consultation with stakeholders.</p>(5)<p contains=\"p\">The fishing opportunities for stocks subject to specific multiannual plans should be established in accordance with the rules laid down in those plans. Consequently, catch limits for the cod, herring and sprat stocks in the Baltic Sea should be established in accordance with the rules laid down in Regulation (EU) No 2016/1139<p contains=\"p\">Regulation (EU) 2016/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 establishing a multiannual plan for the stocks of cod, herring and sprat in the Baltic Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks, amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007, OJ L 191, 15.7.2016, p. 1–15</p>.</p>(6)<p contains=\"p\">Due to changes in the biology of the eastern cod stock, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (‘ICES’) has not been able to establish the biological reference points for cod stocks in ICES subdivisions 25-32, and has instead advised that the TAC for that cod stock be based on the data limited approach. The absence of biological reference points made it impossible to follow the rules for fixing and allocating the fishing opportunities for cod stock in those subdivisions set out in Regulation (EU) No 2016/1139, As failing to fix and allocate fishing opportunities could seriously threaten the sustainability of the cod stock, it is appropriate, therefore, in order to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the CFP, to fix the TAC on the basis of the data limited approach, at a level corresponding to the approach developed and advised by ICES.</p>(7)<p contains=\"p\">Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 sets the objective of the CFP to achieve the maximum sustainable yield exploitation rate by 2015 where possible and, on a progressive, incremental basis at the latest by 2020 for all stocks.</p>(8)<p contains=\"p\">The use of fishing opportunities set out in this Regulation is subject to Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009<p contains=\"p\">Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of 20 November 2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy, amending Regulations (EC) No 847/96, (EC) No 2371/2002, (EC) No 811/2004, (EC) No 768/2005, (EC) No 2115/2005, (EC) No 2166/2005, (EC) No 388/2006, (EC) No 509/2007, (EC) No 676/2007, (EC) No 1098/2007, (EC) No 1300/2008, (EC) No 1342/2008 and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 2847/93, (EC) No 1627/94 and (EC) No 1966/2006 (OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 1OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 1).</p>, and in particular to Articles 33 and 34 thereof concerning the recording of catches and fishing effort, and to the transmission of data on the exhaustion of fishing opportunities to the Commission. This Regulation should therefore specify the codes relating to landings of stocks subject to this Regulation that are to be used by Member States when sending data to the Commission.</p>(9)<p contains=\"p\">Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96<p contains=\"p\">Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96 of 6 May 1996 introducing additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs and quotas (OJ L 115, 9.5.1996, p. 3OJ L 115, 9.5.1996, p. 3).</p>introduced additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs including, under Articles 3 and 4, flexibility provisions for precautionary and analytical TACs. Under Article 2 of that Regulation, when fixing the TACs, the Council is to decide to which stocks Articles 3 or 4 shall not apply, in particular on the basis of the biological status of the stocks. More recently, the year-to-year flexibility mechanism was introduced by Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 for all stocks that are subject to the landing obligation. Therefore, in order to avoid excessive flexibility that would undermine the principle of rational and responsible exploitation of living marine biological resources, hinder the achievement of the objectives of the CFP and deteriorate the biological status of the stocks, it should be established that Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96 apply to analytical TACs only where the year-to-year flexibility provided for in Article 15(9) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 is not used.</p>(10)<p contains=\"p\">In order to avoid interruption of fishing activities and to ensure the livelihoods of Union fishermen, this Regulation should apply from 1 January 2017. For reasons of urgency, this Regulation should enter into force immediately after its publication,</p><p contains=\"p\">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p></div>"}, "sections" : [{   "id": "chapter_1",
