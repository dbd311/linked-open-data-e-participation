Is marriage so demoralising as that?", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "I believe it is a very pleasant state, sir. I have had very little experience of it myself up to the present.

That will do, Lane, thank you.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "Thank you, sir.", "name": "Lane"}, {"text": "Lane's views on marriage seem somewhat lax.

It is very romantic to be in love. But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal. Why, one may be accepted. One usually is, I believe. Then the excitement is all over. The very essence of romance is uncertainty. If ever I get married, I\u2019ll certainly try to forget the fact.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "I have no doubt about that, dear Algy. The Divorce Court was specially invented for people whose memories are so curiously constituted.", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "Oh! there is no use speculating on that subject.

Girls don\u2019t think it right.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "Oh, that is nonsense!", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "It isn\u2019t. It is a great truth.

Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall. That is a matter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself. You seem to think that every aunt should be exactly like your aunt! That is absurd! For Heaven\u2019s sake give me back my cigarette case.", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "Yes. But why does your aunt call you her uncle? \u2018From little Cecily, with her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.\u2019 There is no objection, I admit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, no matter what her size may be, should call her own nephew her uncle, I can\u2019t quite make out.

I have introduced you to every one as Ernest. You answer to the name of Ernest. You look as if your name was Ernest. You are the most earnest-looking person I ever saw in my life. It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn\u2019t Ernest. It\u2019s on your cards. Here is one of them.  \u2018Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany.\u2019 I\u2019ll keep this as a proof that your name is Ernest if ever you attempt to deny it to me, or to Gwendolen, or to any one else.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "Well, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and the cigarette case was given to me in the country.", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "Yes, but that does not account for the fact that your small Aunt Cecily, who lives at Tunbridge Wells, calls you her dear uncle. Come, old boy, you had much better have the thing out at once.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "My dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a dentist. It is very vulgar to talk like a dentist when one isn\u2019t a dentist. It produces a false impression,", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "Well, that is exactly what dentists always do. Now, go on! Tell me the whole thing. I may mention that I have always suspected you of being a confirmed and secret Bunburyist; and I am quite sure of it now.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "Bunburyist? What on earth do you mean by a Bunburyist?", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "I\u2019ll reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expression as soon as you are kind enough to inform me why you are Ernest in town and Jack in the country.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "Well, produce my cigarette case first.", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "Here it is.  Now produce your explanation, and pray make it improbable.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "My dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanation at all. In fact it\u2019s perfectly ordinary. Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who adopted me when I was a little boy, made me in his will guardian to his grand-daughter, Miss Cecily Cardew. Cecily, who addresses me as her uncle from motives of respect that you could not possibly appreciate, lives at my place in the country under the charge of her admirable governess, Miss Prism.", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "Where is that place in the country, by the way?", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "That is nothing to you, dear boy. You are not going to be invited . . . I may tell you candidly that the place is not in Shropshire.", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "I suspected that, my dear fellow! I have Bunburyed all over Shropshire on two separate occasions. Now, go on. Why are you Ernest in town and Jack in the country?", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "My dear Algy, I don\u2019t know whether you will be able to understand my real motives. You are hardly serious enough. When one is placed in the position of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all subjects. It\u2019s one\u2019s duty to do so. And as a high moral tone can hardly be said to conduce very much to either one\u2019s health or one\u2019s happiness, in order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a younger brother of the name of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into the most dreadful scrapes. That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure and simple.", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "The truth is rarely pure and never simple. Modern life would be very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete impossibility!", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "That wouldn\u2019t be at all a bad thing.", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "Literary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow. Don\u2019t try it. You should leave that to people who haven\u2019t been at a University. They do it so well in the daily papers. What you really are is a Bunburyist. I was quite right in saying you were a Bunburyist. You are one of the most advanced Bunburyists I know.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "What on earth do you mean?", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "You have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest, in order that you may be able to come up to town as often as you like. I have invented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury, in order that I may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose. Bunbury is perfectly invaluable. If it wasn\u2019t for Bunbury\u2019s extraordinary bad health, for instance, I wouldn\u2019t be able to dine with you at Willis\u2019s to-night, for I have been really engaged to Aunt Augusta for more than a week.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "I haven\u2019t asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night.", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "I know. You are absurdly careless about sending out invitations. It is very foolish of you. Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving invitations.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "You had much better dine with your Aunt Augusta.", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "I haven\u2019t the smallest intention of doing anything of the kind. To begin with, I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to dine with one\u2019s own relations. In the second place, whenever I do dine there I am always treated as a member of the family, and sent down with either no woman at all, or two. In the third place, I know perfectly well whom she will place me next to, to-night. She will place me next Mary Farquhar, who always flirts with her own husband across the dinner-table. That is not very pleasant. Indeed, it is not even decent . . . and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase. The amount of women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly scandalous. It looks so bad. It is simply washing one\u2019s clean linen in public. Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I naturally want to talk to you about Bunburying. I want to tell you the rules.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "I\u2019m not a Bunburyist at all. If Gwendolen accepts me, I am going to kill my brother, indeed I think I\u2019ll kill him in any case. Cecily is a little too much interested in him. It is rather a bore. So I am going to get rid of Ernest. And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr . . . with your invalid friend who has the absurd name.", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "Nothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and if you ever get married, which seems to me extremely problematic, you will be very glad to know Bunbury. A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has a very tedious time of it.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "That is nonsense. If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen, and she is the only girl I ever saw in my life that I would marry, I certainly won\u2019t want to know Bunbury.", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "Then your wife will. You don\u2019t seem to realise, that in married life three is company and two is none.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "That, my dear young friend, is the theory that the corrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years.", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "Yes; and that the happy English home has proved in half the time.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "For heaven\u2019s sake, don\u2019t try to be cynical. It\u2019s perfectly easy to be cynical.", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "My dear fellow, it isn\u2019t easy to be anything nowadays. There\u2019s such a lot of beastly competition about.  Ah! that must be Aunt Augusta. Only relatives, or creditors, ever ring in that Wagnerian manner. Now, if I get her out of the way for ten minutes, so that you can have an opportunity for proposing to Gwendolen, may I dine with you to-night at Willis\u2019s?", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "I suppose so, if you want to.", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "Yes, but you must be serious about it. I hate people who are not serious about meals. It is so shallow of them.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "Good afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behaving very well.", "name": "Lady Bracknell"}, {"text": "I\u2019m feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "That\u2019s not quite the same thing. In fact the two things rarely go together.", "name": "Lady Bracknell"}, {"text": "Dear me, you are smart!", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "I am always smart! Am I not, Mr. Worthing?", "name": "Gwendolen"}, {"text": "You\u2019re quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "Oh! I hope I am not that. It would leave no room for developments, and I intend to develop in many directions.", "name": "Gwendolen"}, {"text": "I\u2019m sorry if we are a little late, Algernon, but I was obliged to call on dear Lady Harbury. I hadn\u2019t been there since her poor husband\u2019s death. I never saw a woman so altered; she looks quite twenty years younger. And now I\u2019ll have a cup of tea, and one of those nice cucumber sandwiches you promised me.", "name": "Lady Bracknell"}, {"text": "Certainly, Aunt Augusta.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "Won\u2019t you come and sit here, Gwendolen?", "name": "Lady Bracknell"}, {"text": "Thanks, mamma, I\u2019m quite comfortable where I am.", "name": "Gwendolen"}, {"text": "Good heavens! Lane! Why are there no cucumber sandwiches? I ordered them specially.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir. I went down twice.", "name": "Lane"}, {"text": "No cucumbers!", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "No, sir. Not even for ready money.", "name": "Lane"}, {"text": "That will do, Lane, thank you.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "Thank you, sir.", "name": "Lane"}, {"text": "I am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta, about there being no cucumbers, not even for ready money.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "It really makes no matter, Algernon. I had some crumpets with Lady Harbury, who seems to me to be living entirely for pleasure now.", "name": "Lady Bracknell"}, {"text": "I hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "It certainly has changed its colour. From what cause I, of course, cannot say.  Thank you. I\u2019ve quite a treat for you to-night, Algernon. I am going to send you down with Mary Farquhar. She is such a nice woman, and so attentive to her husband. It\u2019s delightful to watch them.", "name": "Lady Bracknell"}, {"text": "I am afraid, Aunt Augusta, I shall have to give up the pleasure of dining with you to-night after all.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "I hope not, Algernon. It would put my table completely out. Your uncle would have to dine upstairs. Fortunately he is accustomed to that.", "name": "Lady Bracknell"}, {"text": "It is a great bore, and, I need hardly say, a terrible disappointment to me, but the fact is I have just had a telegram to say that my poor friend Bunbury is very ill again.  They seem to think I should be with him.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "It is very strange. This Mr. Bunbury seems to suffer from curiously bad health.", "name": "Lady Bracknell"}, {"text": "Yes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that Mr. Bunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die. This shilly-shallying with the question is absurd. Nor do I in any way approve of the modern sympathy with invalids. I consider it morbid. Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others. Health is the primary duty of life. I am always telling that to your poor uncle, but he never seems to take much notice . . . as far as any improvement in his ailment goes. I should be much obliged if you would ask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough not to have a relapse on Saturday, for I rely on you to arrange my music for me. It is my last reception, and one wants something that will encourage conversation, particularly at the end of the season when every one has practically said whatever they had to say, which, in most cases, was probably not much.", "name": "Lady Bracknell"}, {"text": "I\u2019ll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta, if he is still conscious, and I think I can promise you he\u2019ll be all right by Saturday. Of course the music is a great difficulty. You see, if one plays good music, people don\u2019t listen, and if one plays bad music people don\u2019t talk. But I\u2019ll run over the programme I\u2019ve drawn out, if you will kindly come into the next room for a moment.", "name": "Algernon"}, {"text": "Thank you, Algernon. It is very thoughtful of you.  I\u2019m sure the programme will be delightful, after a few expurgations. French songs I cannot possibly allow. People always seem to think that they are improper, and either look shocked, which is vulgar, or laugh, which is worse. But German sounds a thoroughly respectable language, and indeed, I believe is so. Gwendolen, you will accompany me.", "name": "Lady Bracknell"}, {"text": "Certainly, mamma.", "name": "Gwendolen"}, {"text": "Charming day it has been, Miss Fairfax.", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "Pray don\u2019t talk to me about the weather, Mr. Worthing.

And that makes me so nervous.", "name": "Gwendolen"}, {"text": "I do mean something else.", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "I thought so. In fact, I am never wrong.", "name": "Gwendolen"}, {"text": "And I would like to be allowed to take advantage of Lady Bracknell\u2019s temporary absence . . .", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "I would certainly advise you to do so. Mamma has a way of coming back suddenly into a room that I have often had to speak to her about.", "name": "Gwendolen"}, {"text": "Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired you more than any girl . . . I have ever met since . . . I met you.", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "Yes, I am quite well aware of the fact. And I often wish that in public, at any rate, you had been more demonstrative. For me you have always had an irresistible fascination. Even before I met you I was far from indifferent to you.  We live, as I hope you know, Mr Worthing, in an age of ideals. The fact is constantly mentioned in the more expensive monthly magazines, and has reached the provincial pulpits, I am told; and my ideal has always been to love some one of the name of Ernest. There is something in that name that inspires absolute confidence. The moment Algernon first mentioned to me that he had a friend called Ernest, I knew I was destined to love you.", "name": "Gwendolen"}, {"text": "You really love me, Gwendolen?", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "Passionately!", "name": "Gwendolen"}, {"text": "Darling!

But supposing it was something else? Do you mean to say you couldn\u2019t love me then?", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "Ah! that is clearly a metaphysical speculation, and like most metaphysical speculations has very little reference at all to the actual facts of real life, as we know them.", "name": "Gwendolen"}, {"text": "Personally, darling, to speak quite candidly, I don\u2019t much care about the name of Ernest . . . I don\u2019t think the name suits me at all.", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "It suits you perfectly. It is a divine name. It has a music of its own. It produces vibrations.", "name": "Gwendolen"}, {"text": "Well, really, Gwendolen, I must say that I think there are lots of other much nicer names. I think Jack, for instance, a charming name.", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "Jack? . . . No, there is very little music in the name Jack, if any at all, indeed. It does not thrill. It produces absolutely no vibrations . . . I have known several Jacks, and they all, without exception, were more than usually plain. Besides, Jack is a notorious domesticity for John! And I pity any woman who is married to a man called John. She would probably never be allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of a single moment\u2019s solitude.

There is no time to be lost.", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "Married, Mr. Worthing?", "name": "Gwendolen"}, {"text": "Well . . . surely. You know that I love you, and you led me to believe, Miss Fairfax, that you were not absolutely indifferent to me.", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "I adore you. But you haven\u2019t proposed to me yet.

The subject has not even been touched on.", "name": "Gwendolen"}, {"text": "Well . . . may I propose to you now?", "name": "Jack"}, {"text": "I think it would be an admirable opportunity.

To be born, or at any rate bred, in a hand-bag, whether it had handles or not, seems to me to display a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that reminds one of the worst excesses of the French Revolution. And I presume you know what that unfortunate movement led to? As for the particular locality in which the hand-bag was found, a cloak-room at a railway station might serve to conceal a social indiscretion\u2014has probably, indeed, been used for that purpose before now-but it could hardly be regarded as an assured basis for a recognised position in good society.", "name": "Lady Bracknell"}, {"text": "May I ask you then what you would advise me to do?

A few weeks later, through the elaborate investigations of the Metropolitan police, the perambulator was discovered at midnight, standing by itself in a remote corner of Bayswater.

On the morning of the day you mention, a day that is for ever branded on my memory, I prepared as usual to take the baby out in its perambulator. I had also with me a somewhat old, but capacious hand-bag in which I had intended to place the manuscript of a work of fiction that I had written during my few unoccupied hours.
